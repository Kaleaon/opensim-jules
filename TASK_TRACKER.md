### Blocked Items

Currently no blocked items.

### Dependencies and Risks

#### External Dependencies
- .NET 8.0 WPF/WinUI framework availability
- Cross-platform GUI framework decisions
- Community feedback and requirements

#### Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risk**: GUI framework compatibility
  - Mitigation: Prototype early, test on multiple platforms
- **Adoption Risk**: User acceptance of new tools
  - Mitigation: Maintain backward compatibility, gradual rollout
- **Resource Risk**: Development capacity
  - Mitigation: Prioritize critical features, phase delivery

### Weekly Review Schedule

#### Week 1 Goals
- [x] Complete assessment and planning
- [ ] Set up GUI development environment
- [ ] Create initial project structure
- [ ] Design UI mockups

#### Week 2 Goals
- [ ] Implement basic framework
- [ ] Start development of control panel
- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure
- [ ] Begin documentation updates

#### Success Criteria
- Working GUI framework by end of Week 2
- Functional control panel by end of Week 4
- Complete solution ready for testing by Week 8

### Future Phases Preview

#### Phase 3 (Web Interface)
- Web-based management console
- RESTful API for remote management
- Cloud deployment automation

#### Phase 4 (Enterprise Features)
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Mobile management applications
- AI-powered optimization

### Notes and Observations

#### Development Environment
- Build system works well with .NET 8.0
- Project structure is well-organized
- Existing physics improvements provide good foundation

#### Community Considerations
- Focus on maintaining backward compatibility
- Ensure new tools don't interfere with existing workflows
- Plan for gradual adoption and user training

### Action Items for Next Review
1. Complete GUI framework setup
2. Create initial UI mockups
3. Begin implementation of control panel
4. Set up user feedback collection system
